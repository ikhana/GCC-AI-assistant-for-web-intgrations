# GCC AI Assistant for Web Integrations

This project harnesses the power of AI to navigate users through an informational and interactive digital landscape, enabling a seamless and intelligent user experience on our marketing agency's website.

## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get the frontend running locally:

### Installation

- Install Node.js from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/)
- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/repo_name.git`
- Navigate into the project directory: `cd repo_name`
- Install application dependencies: `npm install`
- Start the application: `npm start`

## AI Functionality 

The core of the application resides in our AI-driven assistant, which comprehends user inputs and responds intelligently, guiding users through various pages and segments of the digital space, ensuring a smooth, informative, and interactive experience across the website. The AI assistant:
- Identifies user intent from natural language inquiries
- Dynamically navigates through different sections/pages of the website
- Provides automated responses to common user inquiries
- Enables easy access to various content pieces and sections
- Enhances user engagement by offering instant, relevant information
